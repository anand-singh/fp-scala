# Analysing Twitter Data

``Here we will do so file IO as well as some analysis on data``

##### What we are planning to do;
1. The tweets.csv file contains airline tweet data
2. We are going to do some sentimental analysis
3. For example negative, neutral and positive sentiments towards the air lines
4. [Link to the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment)
5. We will do some file parsing, asynchronous code or even streaming if required :-)
