# Paint app

``This is you first assignment where we will try to explore and implement ideas which we have learnt so far in FP using scala. More specifically what we learned so far in day 1 package``

##### Idea a very simple; 
1. Go through all the ADT provided in the package project1
2. Make sure, if you want to add a behaviour it needs to be with the respective companion or ADT
3. Please add/edit the ADT if you see any improvements (please specify the change in your solution)
4. More details about the ADT and behaviours are in the respective source files
